# BTS Store Management System (C++)

A console-based store management system developed in **C++** that simulates a merchandise store for BTS fans.  
The program allows users to view products, place orders, generate bills, and manage basic store operations through a menu-driven interface.
This project was created as a mini-project to practice core C++ concepts, including functions, conditionals, loops, and user interaction.
